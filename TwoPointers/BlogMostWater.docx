Approach for the “Most Water / Container With Most Water” problem

The idea is to maximize the area formed between two vertical lines in the array.
The area between two lines is calculated by:

area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right – left)

We want to search all possible pairs, but doing it with two pointers avoids the O(n²) brute force.

Step-by-step explanation
1. Start with two pointers

left at the start of the array

right at the end of the array

This gives us the widest possible width initially.

2. Compute the area for the current pair

Height of the container is the shorter of the two heights
h = min(height[left], height[right])

Width is the distance between pointers
w = right - left

Area is h * w.

3. Update the maximum area

Keep track of the biggest area seen so far:

maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);

4. Move the pointer at the shorter line

This is the key insight:

If height[left] < height[right], move left++

Otherwise move right--

Reason:

The area is limited by the shorter line.

Moving the taller line inward cannot increase height.

Moving the shorter line might give a taller line and potentially more area.

5. Continue until left meets right

Loop runs while left < right.

6. Return the maximum area found
Why this works

Every step removes one line (left or right).

We eliminate only the line that cannot help increase the area.

This ensures we check all meaningful pairs in O(n) time instead of checking all pairs in O(n²).
