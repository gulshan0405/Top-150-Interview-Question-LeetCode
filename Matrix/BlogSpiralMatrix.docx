Spiral Order Approach (Step-by-Step)

You are walking around the matrix in layers, starting from the outer layer and moving inward.
To do this, you keep track of four boundaries:

top → starting row

bottom → ending row

left → starting column

right → ending column

At each stage, you move in four directions:

1. Traverse from left to right

You walk along the top row from column left to right.

for (int i = left; i <= right; i++)


After printing the top row, you move the top boundary down:

top++;

2. Traverse from top to bottom

You walk down the rightmost column from row top to bottom.

for (int i = top; i <= bottom; i++)


Then move the right boundary left:

right--;

3. Traverse from right to left

Before doing this step, you check if rows remain:

if (top <= bottom)


Then walk the bottom row from column right to left.

for (int i = right; i >= left; i--)


Move the bottom boundary up:

bottom--;

4. Traverse from bottom to top

Before this step, check if columns remain:

if (left <= right)


Then walk up the leftmost column from row bottom to top.

for (int i = bottom; i >= top; i--)


Move left boundary to the right:

left++;

5. Repeat While There Is Space

The loop continues while:

top <= bottom && left <= right


This ensures you do not cross over the boundaries.

Summary of the Logic
Step	Direction	Row/Column used
1	Left → Right	top row
2	Top → Bottom	right column
3	Right → Left	bottom row
4	Bottom → Top	left column

After each step, you shrink the boundary so the next loop handles the inner layer.
