Step-by-step approach (LeetCode 9 – Palindrome Number)

The given integer x is the number we need to check.

Store the original value of x in another variable (original) because x will be modified during the process.

Initialize a variable rev to 0.
This variable will store the reversed number.

Use a loop that runs while x is greater than 0.

In each iteration of the loop:

Extract the last digit of x using x % 10.

Add this digit to the reversed number by:

multiplying rev by 10

then adding the extracted digit.

Remove the last digit from x by doing integer division x / 10.

Continue this process until all digits of x are processed.

After the loop ends, rev contains the reverse of the original number.

Compare the reversed number (rev) with the original number (original).

If both are equal, the number is a palindrome, so return true.
Otherwise, return false.

Example walkthrough
Input
x = 121


Reverse becomes 121

rev == original → true

Input
x = 123


Reverse becomes 321

rev != original → false

Important notes

This approach works only for non-negative numbers.

Negative numbers automatically return false because their reverse is not the same.

Time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of digits.

Space complexity is O(1).
