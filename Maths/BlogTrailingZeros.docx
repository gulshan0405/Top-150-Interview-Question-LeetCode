Step-by-step approach of your current code (in words)

You are given an integer n.

You try to calculate n! (factorial of n).

You store n in a.

You initialize fact with n.

You use a loop to compute factorial:

Multiply fact with (a - 1)

Decrease a by 1

Repeat until a becomes 1

After computing the factorial, you initialize a variable count to 0.

You then start counting trailing zeros:

Extract the last digit of fact using % 10

If the digit is 0, increase count

If the digit is not 0, stop the loop

Remove the last digit using / 10

Finally, return the number of trailing zeros.

Why this solution is wrong ❌ (very important)
1️⃣ Factorial becomes extremely large

Even for small inputs:

20! is already larger than what long can store

LeetCode test cases go up to n = 10^4

So:

fact overflows

You get incorrect values

Many test cases fail

2️⃣ Unnecessary computation

You do not need to compute factorial at all to find trailing zeros.

3️⃣ Time complexity is too high

Computing factorial is expensive

Extracting digits from a huge number is inefficient

LeetCode 172 is designed to avoid factorial calculation completely.

Correct step-by-step approach (LeetCode 172 – Trailing Zeroes)
Key idea

Trailing zeros are created by factors of 10.
Each 10 = 2 × 5.

There are plenty of 2s in factorials

The number of trailing zeros depends on how many 5s are present

Correct approach in words

Initialize a variable count to 0.

Count how many numbers from 1 to n contribute a factor of 5.

Divide n by 5 and add the result to count.

This counts numbers like 5, 10, 15, 20...

Divide n by 25 and add the result to count.

This counts extra 5s from numbers like 25, 50, 75...

Continue dividing n by higher powers of 5 (125, 625, etc.)
until the result becomes 0.

Return count.

Example walkthrough
Input
n = 10


10 / 5 = 2 → two factors of 5

No higher power contributes

Result = 2

Input
n = 25


25 / 5 = 5

25 / 25 = 1 (extra 5 from 25)

Total trailing zeros = 6

Key takeaway (very important)

❌ Never compute factorial for this problem

✅ Count factors of 5

✅ Efficient and safe

✅ Passes all LeetCode test cases






🧠 Step-by-step Approach (in words)

Trailing zeros in a factorial are created by the number 10s in the result.

Each 10 is formed by multiplying 2 × 5.

In factorials, there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5.

So, the number of trailing zeros depends only on how many times 5 appears as a factor.

Count how many numbers between 1 and n are divisible by 5.

This gives the number of factors of 5.

Some numbers contribute more than one factor of 5:

25 = 5 × 5

125 = 5 × 5 × 5

These must be counted again.

Keep dividing n by increasing powers of 5:

n / 5

n / 25

n / 125

Continue until the division result becomes 0.

Add all these values to get the total number of trailing zeros.

Return the final count.

📌 Example
Input
n = 25

Calculation
25 / 5   = 5
25 / 25  = 1
25 / 125 = 0

Output
5 + 1 = 6


So, 25! has 6 trailing zeros.
