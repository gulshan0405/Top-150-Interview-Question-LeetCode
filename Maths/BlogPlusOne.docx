Step-by-step approach (LeetCode 66 – Plus One)

You are given an array where each element represents one digit of a number.

You need to add 1 to this number and return the result as an array of digits.

Start from the last index of the array because addition always begins from the least significant digit.

Check the current digit:

If the digit is less than 9, simply add 1 to it.

After adding 1, no carry is generated, so the operation is finished. Return the array immediately.

If the digit is 9:

Adding 1 makes it 10.

Write 0 at this position.

Carry 1 to the next digit on the left.

Move one step left and repeat the process.

Continue this process until:

You find a digit less than 9, or

You finish processing all digits.

If all digits were 9, then after adding 1:

Every digit becomes 0.

You need one extra digit at the front.

Create a new array with length original length + 1.

Set the first digit to 1 and leave the rest as 0.

Return the final array.

Example walkthrough
Input
[1, 2, 3]


Start from 3

3 + 1 = 4

Result: [1, 2, 4]

Input
[1, 2, 9]


9 + 1 = 10 → write 0, carry

2 + 1 = 3

Result: [1, 3, 0]

Input
[9, 9, 9]


All digits become 0

Extra digit needed

Result: [1, 0, 0, 0]
