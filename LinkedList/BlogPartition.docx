Approach: Partition List using two dummy lists
Goal

Rearrange the linked list so that:

Nodes with value less than x come first

Nodes with value greater than or equal to x come after

The relative order of nodes in each group remains unchanged

Step 1: Create two dummy nodes

Create one dummy node for values < x

Create another dummy node for values ≥ x

These dummy nodes act as temporary heads and simplify edge cases

Step 2: Initialize pointers

Use one pointer (small) to build the list of nodes < x

Use another pointer (large) to build the list of nodes ≥ x

Start both pointers at their respective dummy nodes

Step 3: Traverse the original list

Start from the head of the original list

Visit each node exactly once

Step 4: Partition nodes

If the current node’s value is less than x, attach it to the small list

Otherwise, attach it to the large list

Move the corresponding pointer forward

Step 5: Move to the next node

Continue traversal until all nodes are processed

Step 6: Terminate the large list

Set large.next = null to avoid cycles

Step 7: Connect both lists

Attach the small list to the head of the large list

Step 8: Return the new head

Return the node after the small dummy node as the new head of the partitioned list
