Problem in one line

You are given two sorted linked lists and you need to merge them into one sorted list.

Example:

list1 = 1 -> 3 -> 5
list2 = 2 -> 4 -> 6


Result:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

Step 1: Create dummy node
ListNode dummy = new ListNode(-1);
ListNode temp = dummy;


dummy is a fake starting node

temp is used to build the merged list

Real answer will start at dummy.next

Initial state:

dummy(-1) -> null
temp ↑

Step 2: Start comparing nodes
while (list1 != null && list2 != null)


This loop runs until one list becomes empty.

Step 3: First comparison
if (list1.val <= list2.val)

Case 1: list1.val is smaller (or equal)
temp.next = list1;
list1 = list1.next;


What happens:

Attach list1 node to merged list

Move list1 forward

Then:

temp = temp.next;


Move temp forward to the newly added node.

Step 4: Else case (list2 is smaller)
temp.next = list2;
list2 = list2.next;
temp = temp.next;


Same logic, just using list2.

Step 5: Dry run with example
Initial:
list1: 1 -> 3 -> 5
list2: 2 -> 4 -> 6

merged: dummy

Iteration 1:

Compare 1 and 2

Take 1

merged: -1 -> 1
list1: 3 -> 5
list2: 2 -> 4 -> 6

Iteration 2:

Compare 3 and 2

Take 2

merged: -1 -> 1 -> 2
list1: 3 -> 5
list2: 4 -> 6

Iteration 3:

Compare 3 and 4

Take 3

merged: -1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
list1: 5
list2: 4 -> 6

Iteration 4:

Compare 5 and 4

Take 4

merged: -1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
list1: 5
list2: 6

Iteration 5:

Compare 5 and 6

Take 5

merged: -1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
list1: null
list2: 6


Loop ends because list1 is null.

Step 6: Attach remaining nodes
if (list1 != null) {
    temp.next = list1;
}
if (list2 != null) {
    temp.next = list2;
}


Only one of these will run

Remaining nodes are already sorted

Just attach them directly

Result:

-1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

Step 7: Return final answer
return dummy.next;


Skip the fake node.

Final merged list:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

Why this approach is good

No extra nodes created

Time complexity: O(n + m)

Space complexity: O(1)

Clean pointer movement

Very interview-friendly
