Approach (Step by Step)

Create a list to store the result.
This list will hold strings like "1->3" or "7".

Loop through the array.
Use a pointer i that moves through nums.

Mark the start of a potential range.
Set start = nums[i].
This is the first number of the current range.

Extend the range while numbers are consecutive.
Keep moving i forward as long as the next number is exactly 1 more than the current number (nums[i+1] == nums[i] + 1).

Check if it's a range or a single number.

If the range started at start and ended at a different number (start != nums[i]), then you found a range.
Add "start->end" to the answer.

Otherwise, if start == nums[i], it’s just a single number.
Add "start".

Continue until the loop ends.

Return the list.

Example

For input:
[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7]

Start at 0 → 1 → 2 → stop → add "0->2"

Start at 4 → 5 → stop → add "4->5"

Start at 7 → stop → add "7"

Output:
["0->2", "4->5", "7"]
