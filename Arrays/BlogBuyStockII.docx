Step-by-step approach

Initialize totalProfit to 0.
This variable will accumulate profit from every increasing price segment.

Iterate through the array starting from index 1.
You compare each price with the previous day's price.

Check if today's price is greater than yesterday’s price.

If prices[i] > prices[i - 1], it means the price went up.

You can pretend you bought yesterday and sold today to capture that profit.

Add the difference to totalProfit.

Profit for this small rise is prices[i] - prices[i - 1].

Add it to totalProfit.

Repeat for all prices.
This lets you capture profit from every increasing segment, which is allowed because multiple buy-sell transactions are permitted (as long as you sell before buying again).

Return totalProfit.

Why this works (intuition)

Instead of trying to find the big valleys and peaks, this solution collects all small profits from every upward movement.
Those small profits added together equal the maximum possible profit when unlimited transactions are allowed.

Example walk-through

Prices: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]

1 → 5: price increased → profit += 4

5 → 3: price dropped → no profit

3 → 6: price increased → profit += 3

6 → 4: price dropped → no profit

Total profit = 4 + 3 = 7
