Approach to Merge Two Sorted Arrays (nums1 and nums2)
1. Create a new array to store the merged result

We create an array merge of size m + n to hold the final sorted result.

2. Use two pointers to compare elements

size1 → pointer for nums1 (only the first m valid elements)

size2 → pointer for nums2

i → pointer for the merge array

3. Compare elements from both arrays

While both pointers are within bounds:

If nums1[size1] is smaller or equal, copy it to merge.

Otherwise, take the element from nums2.

This step keeps the merged result sorted.

4. Copy the remaining elements

If any elements are left in either array:

Copy leftover elements from nums1

Copy leftover elements from nums2

One of these loops will run, depending on which array still has elements.

5. Copy merged array back to nums1

Finally, copy all elements from merge[] into nums1[] so the result is stored in nums1.
