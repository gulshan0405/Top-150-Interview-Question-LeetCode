Step 1: Check length of both strings

If the lengths of s and t are not equal, return false because strings of different lengths cannot be isomorphic.

Step 2: Create two HashMaps

One HashMap to store character mapping from string s to string t

Another HashMap to store character mapping from string t to string s

This helps maintain a one-to-one relationship between characters.

Step 3: Traverse both strings together

Loop through the strings from index 0 to length - 1 and pick one character from each string at the same position.

Step 4: Check mapping from s to t

If the current character from s already exists in the map:

Verify it maps to the same character in t

If it maps to a different character, return false

If it does not exist:

Add the new mapping to the map

Step 5: Check mapping from t to s

If the current character from t already exists in the map:

Verify it maps to the same character in s

If it maps to a different character, return false

If it does not exist:

Add the new mapping to the map

Step 6: Continue for all characters

Repeat steps 4 and 5 for every character pair in both strings.

Step 7: Return result

If the loop completes without any mismatch, return true because the strings are isomorphic.

Summary

This approach ensures:

Each character always maps to the same character

No two characters map to the same character
